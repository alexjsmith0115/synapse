## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.13] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **C# ASP.NET Core Minimal API endpoint detection** — `MapGet`, `MapPost`, `MapPut`, `MapDelete`, and `MapPatch` calls now produce HTTP_ENDPOINT nodes in the graph
- **`RestTemplate.exchange()` detection** — Java HTTP extractor now recognizes `RestTemplate.exchange()` calls with `HttpMethod.X` verb arguments
- **MSTest attribute support** — `[TestMethod]` and `[DataTestMethod]` attributes now produce TESTS edges

### Fixed
- **7 Java tool issues** — import routing, `_clean_java_full_name`, per-file source root detection, anonymous class filter, `kind=4` NAMESPACE mapping, and accurate line numbers via `selectionRange.start.line`
- **`scope=edit` empty-state visibility** — `get_context_for` with `scope=edit` now shows a clearer message when no callers/callees exist
- **HTTP endpoint section in `get_context_for`** — edit scope now includes HTTP endpoints associated with the symbol
- **Result limits** — `find_dead_code` and `find_untested` now accept a `limit` parameter to cap output size
- **`_get_service` singleton invalidation** — CLI service cache now invalidates when the target project path changes
- **`Repository.name`** — `upsert_repository` now derives `Repository.name` from `os.path.basename(path)` instead of storing the full path

## [1.4.12] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Java package extraction** — package declarations are now extracted via tree-sitter and wired as Package CONTAINS edges in the graph

### Fixed
- **NUnit attribute support** — `[Test]` and `[TestCase]` attributes now produce TESTS edges (previously only `[Fact]`/`[Theory]` from xUnit were recognized)
- **Java method attribute lookup** — parameter signatures are now stripped before matching attribute names, fixing false negatives on annotated methods

## [1.4.11] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Cursor MCP config detection** — `synapps init` no longer requires `.cursor/` directory to pre-exist; the directory is created if needed

## [1.4.10] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Agent instruction file installation** — `synapps init` now installs agent instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, etc.) into projects for immediate AI agent context

## [1.4.8] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **`find_usages` parameter cleanup** — removed misleading `include_test_breakdown` parameter that was accepted but silently ignored

## [1.4.7] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Version display** — `synapps status` CLI command and `list_projects` MCP tool now include the Synapps version in their output
- **Cross-language integration tests** — 30+ new integration tests ensuring MCP and CLI tool parity across all 4 language suites (C#, Python, TypeScript, Java)

## [1.4.6] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **DISPATCHES_TO callers included in caller lookups** — `find_callers` and `find_callers_with_sites` now include callers that reach a method via interface dispatch (DISPATCHES_TO edges), which were previously excluded

## [1.4.5] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **C# generic method call extraction** — generic invocations like `_service.Method<T>()` and `new List<string>()` now correctly produce CALLS edges; previously the `generic_name` AST node in `invocation_expression` and `object_creation_expression` was not matched by the tree-sitter query, silently dropping all generic method calls from the graph

## [1.4.4] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **Cross-file edges preserved during incremental reindex** — `reindex_file` no longer drops CALLS and DISPATCHES_TO edges to symbols defined in other files

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **Declaring-type lookup scoped to current file** — `_index_base_types()` now restricts declaring-type resolution to the current file, preventing cross-file false-positive base type matches

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-30

### Changed
- **LSP-based base type resolution** — `_index_base_types()` now uses Language Server Protocol for base type resolution instead of namespace disambiguation; all 4 language extractors return 5-tuples with position data; dead namespace disambiguation functions removed

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **C# generic HTTP method extraction** — `GetFromJsonAsync<T>`, `PostAsJsonAsync<T>`, and other generic `System.Net.Http.Json` methods now correctly produce HTTP_CALLS edges; previously the `generic_name` AST node caused the method name to be missed
- **False-positive IMPLEMENTS edges across projects** — structural protocol dispatch (matching classes to interfaces by method names) is now restricted to Python only; C#, Java, and TypeScript use nominal typing where IMPLEMENTS edges come from LSP declarations
- **Cursor hooks installed at user-level instead of project-level** — `synapps init` now writes Cursor hooks to `<project>/.cursor/hooks.json` instead of `~/.cursor/hooks.json`

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Pre-tool hooks for agent nudging** — gate scripts that remind AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) to query the Synapps graph before reading or editing files; installed via `synapps init`
- **`find_dead_code` MCP tool** *(experimental)* — find methods with zero callers, excluding tests, HTTP handlers, interface implementations, dispatch targets, constructors, and overrides
- **`find_tests_for` MCP tool** *(experimental)* — find which tests cover a given method via direct TESTS edge lookup
- **`find_untested` MCP tool** *(experimental)* — find production methods with no test coverage (same exclusions as `find_dead_code`)
- **`get_architecture` MCP tool** — single-call architecture overview returning packages, hotspots, HTTP endpoint map, and project stats
- **Import-based call resolution fallback** — tree-sitter-based `build_import_map` provides call resolution when the language server misses untyped symbols (TypeScript)
- **`@/` path alias resolution** — `tsconfig.json` path aliases (e.g., `@/*`) are resolved during TypeScript import mapping
- **Hook installer framework** — agent detector, per-agent config upsert/removal, gate script content constants, and force/skip logic
- **Shared vs dedicated database prompt** — `synapps init` now asks whether to use a shared or dedicated Memgraph instance
- **CI integration test job** — GitHub Actions workflow with Memgraph, .NET SDK, Node.js, and Java

### Changed
- **MCP tools consolidated from 21 to 15** — removed `get_symbol`, `get_symbol_source`, `find_callers`, `trace_call_chain`; merged `analyze_change_impact` into `get_context_for(scope='impact')` and `trace_http_dependency` into `find_http_endpoints(trace=True)`
- Removed standalone `synapps install` / `synapps uninstall` CLI commands — hooks are now offered during `synapps init`
- Removed CLI commands redundant with MCP tools
- Two-tone ASCII banner — SYN in dark green, APPS in light green
- Removed obsolete docs (demo, HTTP strategy, distribution, MCP consolidation)

### Fixed
- Strip JSONC comments from `tsconfig.json` before parsing path aliases
- `get_context_for` now resolves impact scope before symbol lookup
- `synapps init` auto-starts Memgraph instead of failing when the container is not running
- CI per-test timeout no longer bounds fixture setup (`timeout_func_only`)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **Renamed project from Synapse to Synapps** — repository moved to SynappsCodeComprehension org
- Streamlined README from 777 to 449 lines
- Fixed HTTP client libraries table — added C#/Java, removed unsupported Python libs

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **PyPI distribution** — install via `pip install synapps-mcp` (package renamed from `synapps` to `synapps-mcp`)
- **`synapps init` command** — interactive setup wizard that detects project languages, checks prerequisites, indexes the project, and configures MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot)
- **`__version__` attribute** — `synapps.__version__` returns the installed version at runtime via `importlib.metadata`
- **CI/CD publish workflow** — `.github/workflows/publish.yml` builds, smoke-tests, and publishes to PyPI on `v*` tags via OIDC trusted publishing
- **Wheel smoke test** — CI verifies `solidlsp` and all 4 tree-sitter grammars are included in the published wheel
- **Platform-aware doctor fix strings** — every failed check shows exact install commands for macOS (`brew`) or Linux (`apt-get`)
- **Actionable error messages** — Docker-not-running, Memgraph connection lost, project-not-indexed, and language server timeout errors all show recovery commands
- **MCP client auto-detection** — `synapps init` finds installed MCP clients and offers to write config with atomic merge (preserves existing server entries)

### Changed
- Package distribution name changed from `synapps` to `synapps-mcp` (Python import paths unchanged)
- `synapps doctor` now exits with code 1 when any check fails (enables use in scripts and CI)
- SYNAPPS logo banner moved from `synapps index` (first run) to `synapps init`
- Version bumped from 1.0.0 to 1.2.0

### Fixed
- Language server timeout no longer aborts the entire indexing pass — timed-out files are skipped with a warning naming the file

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- `find_http_endpoints` MCP tool — search endpoints by route pattern, HTTP method, or language
- `trace_http_dependency` MCP tool — find server handler and all client call sites for an endpoint
- Route conflict detection — indexer warns when multiple methods serve the same (HTTP method, route) pair
- JAX-RS annotation support (`@Path`, `@GET`, `@POST`, etc.) in Java server-side extraction
- README HTTP Endpoint Tracing section with supported frameworks table, tool examples, and known limitations

### Fixed
- Nested class HTTP call attribution now uses narrowest-range matching instead of last-match across all 4 extractors
- JAX-RS route constraints (`{param: regex}`) correctly normalized to `{param}` during extraction

### Changed
- HTTP endpoint extraction now runs by default — no longer requires `experimental.http_endpoints` config flag
- MCP tool count increased from 19 to 21
- Removed all "experimental" qualifiers from schema notes, agent instructions, and log messages

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-26
