**Give your AI agent a deep understanding of your codebase — not just files and symbols, but the relationships between them.**

Synapse is an MCP server and CLI that builds a queryable graph of your codebase using Language Server Protocol analysis. It indexes symbols, call chains, inheritance trees, interface implementations, and type dependencies across C#, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Java projects — then lets AI agents (or humans) query that graph to make safer, faster, better-informed code changes.

> **Work in progress.** Synapse is under active development. APIs, CLI commands, and graph schema may change without notice.

## Why Synapse

AI agents working with code today rely on grep and file reads. That works for simple lookups, but falls apart when the question is *"what happens if I change this?"* — when the answer depends on call chains, interface dispatch, inheritance, and test coverage spanning dozens of files.

Synapse gives your agent a compiler-grade understanding of how code connects, without reading every file.

| Without Synapse | With Synapse |
|---|---|
| Grep for `.DoWork(` across the codebase, filter false positives manually | `find_callers("DoWork")` — precise results, including calls through interfaces |
| Read 5+ files to understand a method before editing | `get_context_for("X", scope="edit")` — source, callers, dependencies, and test coverage in one call |
| Hope you found every caller before refactoring | `analyze_change_impact("X")` — structured impact report with test coverage |
| Manually trace from a method to its API endpoint | `find_entry_points("X")` — automatic root-caller discovery |
| Guess which tests cover a method | Impact analysis separates prod callers from test callers automatically |

## Key Features

### Deep Call Graph

Synapse uses a two-phase indexing approach: LSP extracts structural symbols (classes, methods, properties), then tree-sitter finds call sites and LSP resolves what each call points to. The result is a graph of CALLS edges between methods — not string matches, but semantically resolved references.

This means your agent can follow a method call through 6 levels of indirection and know exactly what code is reachable, without reading a single file.

**Tools:** `find_callers`, `find_callees`, `trace_call_chain`, `get_call_depth`, `find_entry_points`

### Interface Dispatch Resolution

In dependency-injected codebases, `service.Process()` could mean any of 5 concrete implementations. Grep finds the interface method. Synapse finds the interface method *and* every concrete implementation, automatically.

The graph models interface dispatch explicitly: `find_callers("IOrderService.Process")` returns callers of every class that implements `Process`, not just callers of the interface declaration.

**Tools:** `find_callers` (with `include_interface_dispatch`), `find_implementations`, `find_interface_contract`

### Impact Analysis

Before your agent changes a method, it should know: how many places call it, whether tests cover it, and what it depends on. `analyze_change_impact` answers all three in a single, token-efficient response — categorized into direct callers, transitive callers (2-4 hops), test coverage, and downstream callees.

**Tools:** `analyze_change_impact`, `find_type_impact`, `get_context_for` (with `scope="edit"`)

### Scoped Context

`get_context_for` is the recommended starting point for understanding any symbol. Instead of reading entire files, your agent gets exactly the context it needs:

- **`structure`** — type overview with member signatures (no method bodies)
- **`method`** — source code + interface contract + callees + dependencies
- **`edit`** — callers with line numbers, relevant dependencies, test coverage

The right scope means fewer tokens spent on context your agent won't use.

**Tools:** `get_context_for`

### Automatic Graph Sync

The graph stays fresh without manual intervention. When `auto_sync` is enabled (the default), every tool call checks whether the codebase has changed since the last index — using `git diff` for git repos, or file modification times otherwise — and re-indexes only the changed files.

For longer sessions, `watch_project` keeps the graph updated in real-time as files change on disk.

**Tools:** `sync_project`, `get_index_status`

### Token-Efficient Output

Synapse is designed for AI consumption. Outputs use shortened symbol references (`OrderService.Process` instead of `Com.Example.Services.OrderService.Process`), relative file paths, and compact text formats. Tools like `find_usages` and `analyze_change_impact` return structured Markdown summaries instead of raw JSON arrays, reducing token consumption while preserving all the information an agent needs to make decisions.

### Multi-Language, One Interface

C#, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Java projects all use the same tools, the same graph schema, and the same query patterns. Each language has a plugin that handles LSP communication, call site extraction, import resolution, and type reference detection — but the agent doesn't need to know any of that. `find_callers` works the same whether the codebase is C# or Python.

### HTTP Endpoint Tracing (Experimental)

> **Opt-in.** Add `"experimental": { "http_endpoints": true }` to your `.synapse/config.json` to enable.

In full-stack projects with a backend API and a frontend client, Synapse can trace HTTP dependencies across the language boundary. It detects server-side endpoint definitions (e.g., ASP.NET `[HttpGet]` controller methods) and client-side HTTP calls (e.g., `api.get('/items')` in TypeScript), matches them by route pattern, and links them through shared `Endpoint` nodes in the graph.

This means your agent can answer questions like *"what frontend code calls this controller action?"* or *"what backend handler does this service method hit?"* — without grepping for URL strings.

```cypher
-- Frontend → Backend: what does this React service method call?
MATCH (fe:Method)-[:HTTP_CALLS]->(ep:Endpoint)<-[:SERVES]-(be:Method)
WHERE fe.full_name = 'itemService.getAll'
RETURN be.full_name, ep.route

-- Backend → Frontend: what calls this controller action?
MATCH (be:Method)-[:SERVES]->(ep:Endpoint)<-[:HTTP_CALLS]-(fe:Method)
WHERE be.full_name = 'ItemsController.GetAll'
RETURN fe.full_name, ep.route
```

**Currently supported:**
- **Server-side:** C# / ASP.NET Core (`[ApiController]`, `[Route]`, `[HttpGet]`, etc.)
- **Client-side:** TypeScript / JavaScript (axios, fetch, template literals, constant references)

Route matching handles parameterized paths (`{id}` on either side) and common base URL prefixes (`/api`, `/api/v1`).

### Multi-Project Isolation

Each project gets its own Memgraph instance via Docker, named deterministically from the project path. Index 10 projects simultaneously — queries from each directory hit the correct graph automatically. Containers persist across sessions and restart on demand.

## Supported Languages

| Language | File Extensions | Language Server |
|---|---|---|
| C# | `.cs` | Roslyn Language Server |
| Python | `.py` | Pyright |
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` | typescript-language-server |
| Java | `.java` | Eclipse JDTLS |

All languages use the same tools, graph schema, and query patterns. Language detection is automatic based on file extensions, or can be specified explicitly with `--language`.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Docker** — Synapse automatically manages per-project Memgraph containers
- **.NET SDK** — required for C# projects (Roslyn Language Server is auto-downloaded on first index)
- **Pyright** (`npm install -g pyright`) — required for Python projects
- **typescript-language-server** (`npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript`) — required for TypeScript/JavaScript projects

## How it works

When you run any Synapse command from a project directory, Synapse automatically:

1. Creates a `.synapse/config.json` in the project root with a deterministic container name and port
2. Starts a dedicated Memgraph Docker container for that project (or reuses an existing one)
3. Connects to the container's Bolt port for all graph operations

Each project's graph is fully isolated — indexing project A has no effect on project B. Containers are named `synapse-<hash>` based on the absolute project path, so they persist across sessions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This installs two entry points:

- `synapse` — CLI
- `synapse-mcp` — MCP server

## MCP Server Setup

Add Synapse to your MCP client config (e.g. Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "synapse": {
      "command": "synapse-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server resolves the project from the current working directory at startup and connects to its Memgraph container automatically.

---

## Graph model

### Node labels

Structural nodes (identified by `path`):

- `:Repository` — the indexed project root
- `:Directory` — a directory within the project
- `:File` — a source file

Symbol nodes (identified by `full_name`):

- `:Package` — a namespace or package
- `:Class` — classes, abstract classes, enums, and records (distinguished by the `kind` property)
- `:Interface` — interfaces
- `:Method` — methods (with `signature`, `is_abstract`, `is_static`, `line` properties)
- `:Property` — properties (with `type_name`)
- `:Field` — fields (with `type_name`)

A `:Summarized` label is added to any node that has a user-attached summary.

When HTTP endpoint extraction is enabled:

- `:Endpoint` — an HTTP endpoint (with `route`, `http_method`, `name` properties)

### Relationships

- `CONTAINS` — structural containment: Repository→Directory, Directory→File, File→Symbol, and Class/Package→nested symbols
- `IMPORTS` — file imports a package/namespace
- `CALLS` — method calls another method (with optional `call_sites` property for line/column tracking)
- `OVERRIDES` — method overrides a base method
- `IMPLEMENTS` — class implements an interface; also used at method level for interface method→concrete implementation
- `DISPATCHES_TO` — interface method→concrete implementation (inverse of method-level IMPLEMENTS, used for call graph traversal)
- `INHERITS` — class inherits from another class, or interface extends another interface
- `REFERENCES` — symbol references a type (field type, parameter type, return type)

When HTTP endpoint extraction is enabled:

- `SERVES` — method handles an HTTP endpoint (controller action → Endpoint)
- `HTTP_CALLS` — method makes an HTTP request to an endpoint (frontend service → Endpoint, with `call_sites`)

Fully-qualified names (e.g. `MyNamespace.MyClass.DoWork`) are used as symbol identifiers throughout.

## Multi-project usage

Synapse manages Docker containers automatically. Each project directory you work in gets its own isolated Memgraph instance:

```bash
# Index two different projects — each gets its own container
cd /path/to/project-a && synapse index .
cd /path/to/project-b && synapse index .

# Queries from each directory hit the correct graph
cd /path/to/project-a && synapse search "Controller"  # searches project A's graph
cd /path/to/project-b && synapse search "Controller"  # searches project B's graph
```

Container and port configuration is stored in `.synapse/config.json` in each project root. Add `.synapse/` to your `.gitignore`.

Containers persist across sessions. If a container was stopped, Synapse automatically restarts it on the next command. To clean up:

```bash
# Containers can be managed with standard Docker commands
docker ps --filter "name=synapse-"     # list Synapse containers
docker stop synapse-abc123def456       # stop a specific container
docker rm synapse-abc123def456         # remove a specific container
```

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run unit tests (no Docker, Memgraph, or .NET required)
pytest tests/unit/

# Run integration tests (requires Docker + Memgraph on localhost:7687 and .NET SDK)
docker compose up -d
pytest tests/integration/ -m integration
```

## AI Agent Configuration

Synapse automatically provides usage instructions to any MCP-compliant client via the protocol — most AI agents will make good tool choices out of the box.

The snippets below are **optional** additions for your AI platform's rules/instructions file. They provide platform-specific optimizations that go beyond what the MCP protocol delivers.

## Synapse MCP

This project is indexed by the Synapse MCP server. Use it instead of grep/read for navigating code relationships:

- Before modifying a method, use `get_context_for` (scope="edit") to understand its callers, callees, dependencies, and test coverage
- Use `find_callers` / `find_usages` to trace how a symbol is used across the codebase — prefer this over grep
- Use `find_callees` or `get_call_depth` to understand what a method depends on downstream
- After making changes, use `analyze_change_impact` to verify no unexpected breakage
- Use `get_hierarchy` to understand inheritance before modifying class structures
- Use `search_symbols` to find symbols by name, kind, file, or namespace — faster and more precise than file search
- Use `execute_query` for ad-hoc Cypher queries; call `get_schema` first to see available labels and relationships
- Synapse tools appear as `mcp__synapse__<tool_name>` (e.g., `mcp__synapse__get_context_for`)
- Prefer Synapse tools over grep and Read for navigating code structure and call relationships
- Parallelize independent Synapse calls when possible (e.g., `find_callers` and `find_callees` for different methods)
```

# Synapse MCP

Use Synapse MCP tools for all code navigation and understanding tasks. Do not use grep or file reads when a Synapse tool can answer the question.

## Before editing code
- Call get_context_for with scope="edit" to see callers, dependencies, and test coverage

## Finding code
- search_symbols to find symbols by name (supports kind, namespace, file_path, language filters)
- find_implementations to find classes implementing an interface
- get_hierarchy to understand inheritance chains

## Understanding call relationships
- find_callers to find who calls a method (includes interface dispatch automatically)
- find_callees to find what a method calls
- find_usages for unified lookup (auto-selects strategy by symbol kind)
- trace_call_chain to find paths between two methods
- find_entry_points to find API/controller entry points that reach a method

## Impact analysis
- analyze_change_impact before and after changes
- find_type_impact to find code affected by type shape changes
- find_dependencies for constructor/field type dependencies

## Reading code
- get_symbol_source for source code of a specific symbol
- get_context_for for source code plus relationships in one call

## Raw queries
- Call get_schema before writing Cypher
- execute_query is a last resort — use dedicated tools when possible

# Synapse MCP

This project has a Synapse MCP server providing code intelligence tools. Use these tools proactively for code navigation — they are faster and more accurate than grep or file reads for understanding code structure.

## Essential workflow
1. Use `search_symbols` to find symbols by name (don't guess fully-qualified names)
2. Use `get_context_for` with `scope="edit"` before modifying any method
3. Use `analyze_change_impact` after making changes to verify safety

## Tool selection
- Callers of a method: `find_callers` (not raw Cypher)
- Callees of a method: `find_callees`
- All usages of any symbol: `find_usages`
- Interface implementations: `find_implementations`
- Inheritance chain: `get_hierarchy`
- Source code: `get_symbol_source`
- Full context: `get_context_for`
- Call paths: `trace_call_chain`
- Entry points: `find_entry_points`
- Dependencies: `find_dependencies`
- Raw Cypher: `get_schema` then `execute_query` (last resort)
